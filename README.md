# Network-Filtering

Matlab routine that implements the efficiency-cost optimization (ECO) algorithm to filter a weighted adjacency connectivity matrix and get a sparse resprentation of the network.

The method has been introduced in	De Vico Fallani F, Latora V, Chavez M. A topological criterion for filtering information in complex brain networks. Plos Computational Biology. 13(1): e10053052017, 2017 https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005305
